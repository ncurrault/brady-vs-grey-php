<p class="row">To conserve processor and network resources, this app should only update four times per day.</p>
<p class="row">This web app is available in two views:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="/">Improved</a></li>
	<li><a href="/classic.php">Classic</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Updates</h3>
<p class="row">On 2022-11-30, a Heroku issue that took the app down for a few days was resolved.</p>
<p class="row">On 2020-10-01, a "behind the scenes" update made the app much cheaper to host, but the first new request of each day will take a while to load. If you get a blank page, try again in a few minutes.</p>
<p class="row">On 2017-03-17, an update removed consideration for Computerphile, as suggested on <a href="https://youtu.be/l6sSwPVK8EQ?t=1h1m23s">H.I. #79: From Russia with Love</a></p>
<p class="row">Between 2015-05-31 and 2015-06-24, I updated to Google's new API (v3).  This caused a few errors with the site, but it should be fixed now.</p>
<p class="row">On 2015-01-06, an update added Brady's new channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtwKon9qMt5YLVgQt1tvJKg">Objectivity</a>.</p>
<p class="row">On 2014-10-11, an update removed the consideration for Grey's second channel, CGPGrey2.</p>
